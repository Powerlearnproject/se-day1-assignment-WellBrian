Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.  
Software Engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools todevelopment and maintenance of high-quality software systems  
**Its importance in the technology industry**  
- In today's digital age, technology is extensively being used in various sectors, such as healthcare, transportation, and finance that has led to growing demand for innovation and reliable software solutions  
- Development of realistic graphics, special effects and seamless user interfaces heavily relies on the expertise of software engineers  
- By leveraging software engineering principles, we can create innovative solutions that enhance communication, productivity and overall user experience  
- It is pivotal in the evolution of smart cities  
- Software engineers are instrumental in designing sustainable solutions for urban development  


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
**Programming languages**  
There have been development of programming languages (e.g. Lantern, C)  
**Discipline**  
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s  
**Agile Methodologies**  
There have been rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s  
**Structural Programming**  
There have been advent structural programming in the 1970s which are being applied to date  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.  
**Requirements** --> Gathering and documenting users needs and system requirements  
**Design** --> Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface that resonates with requirements  
**Implementation** --> Coding and building software according to design specification  
**Testing** --> Conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements  
**Deployment** --> Releasing software to users or customers  
**Maintenance** --> Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.  
**Waterfall** --> Uses sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall  
#### Example Scenarios When Using Waterfall  
- Building infrastructure e.g., bridges, highways. They require careful upfront planning and cannot easily change once started  
- Manufacturing Industry: Assembly line production requires detailed design before execution  
  
**Agile** --> Uses iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change  
#### Example Scenarios When Using Agile  
- Software Development with Evolving Requirements: web apps, mobile apps, or SaaS products where customer needs change frequently  
  
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.  
**Software Developer** --> Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions  
**Quality Assurance Engineer** --> Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans  
**Project Manager** --> Oversees planning, execution, and delivery of software projects  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.   
**IDEs** --> Provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes, e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse  
**VCS** --> Tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members, e.g., Git  

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
**Common Challenges**  
- Changing requirements
- Technical debt
- Tight deadlines 
 
**Strategies to overcome**  
- Effective communication  
- Prioritization of tasks
- Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines
- Agile methodologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.  
**Unit testing** --> testing individual components or modules of software  
**Integration testing** --> testing interactions between different components or subsystems  
**System testing** --> testing entire software system as a whole  
**Acceptance testing**  --> testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#### Importance of Quality Control  
Help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.  
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get best possible responses from AI models  
**Importance**  
Helps avoid getting confusing answers by making questions clear, concise and specific instead of being vague, so that AI understands exactly what one needs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.  
**Vague prompt** --> Write about technology  
**Improved prompt** --> Write how AI is transforming healthcare focusing on diagnostics and personalized treatment

Why improved prompt is more effective  
- Clear
- Specific
- Concise
